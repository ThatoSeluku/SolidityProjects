Whenever you deploy a smart contract to the blockchain, you're actually changing the
blockchain state.
Migrations are used to change the state of the blockchain. Think of a database as the blockchain, 
everything is stored on the blockchain it is then state-updated using migrations when contracts are deployed 
to the Ethereum network.
